## The Odin Project, Foundations Path, JavaScript Basics "Calculator" project


Design based on Windows 10 calculator functonality.

I believe I covered all the EXTRA CREDIT stuff and a few additional features.

There are some known issues
- This is not responsive by design, buttons sizes are static, one hack for wraping display field has fixed width.
- Using a bunch of globals, haven't done anything with modules or classes yet, future projects will suck less.
- Not doing anything to validate numbers out of range, assuming it will result in NaN.
- I think my aproach may be over complicate.
I wanted to avoid hard coded crap, did not want a bunch of if statements compairing key values.
